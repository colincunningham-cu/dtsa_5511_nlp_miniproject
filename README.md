# DTSA 5511 Disaster Tweets Mini-Project

## Project Overview
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). However, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

## Data Overview
The data used in this project was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data) and contains textual data from real tweets. In total, the training data contains 7,613 rows and 5 columns, whereas the test data contains 3,263 observations and all of the columns mentioned above excluding the target variable.

## Results & Conclusions
See the Jupyter notebook contained within this repository for full analysis and conclusions.
